# 👋 Hi there! I'm Haziq

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a **self-taught programmer** passionate about solving real-world problems through code.  
My journey began in **2022**, when I was working at a startup drone company. Fascinated by the rapid growth of A.I. technologies and their practical applications, I began exploring **YOLO object detection models**, which eventually led me to **PyQt5** for building desktop apps. Since then, I've been diving deeper into **software development**, **A.I. (object detection)**, and currently, **web development** through hands-on projects and self-guided learning.
